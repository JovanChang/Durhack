## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project likely comes from a desire to improve financial literacy among pre-teens and teenagers to help them learn about saving and make it a good habit for the future. not only for the teenagers that can use it, but it is good for everyone, so we make this app easy to use, understand, and suitable for everyone.


## What it does

For the app, when you log in to the account, you will see it separated into 3 sections: my savings, my spending, and my analysis. My saving is to put the money that you receive every day, and we make it easy to use by just clicking how much you got and designing it to look fun when using it with the piggy bank character. Next, in my spending, you can choose the category that you spend on and type the amount of it. It will also show how much you used for that month, and for the analysis, it will show overall how much you spent and saved daily, weekly, and yearly in a bar chart pattern to make it easy to understand.
